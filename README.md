## Hi Everyone! ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ¤– I'm a 4th year Computer Science major at **UCI** interested in full stack development!     
ğŸ’ª I'm currently working on a datacenter website to help students be knowledgable of the variety of buildings within the University of California, Irvine campus for benefits like knowing where one can go to study at certain hours.
